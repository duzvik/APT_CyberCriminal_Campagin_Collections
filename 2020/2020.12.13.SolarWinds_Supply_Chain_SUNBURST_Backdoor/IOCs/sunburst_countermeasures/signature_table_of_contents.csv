SUNBURST,APT_Backdoor_SUNBURST_1,yara,N/A,production,"This rule looks for portions of the SUNBURST backdoor that are vital to how it functions. The first signature fnv_xor matches a magic byte xor that the sample performs on process, service, and driver names/paths.

SUNBURST,APT_Backdoor_SUNBURST_2,yara,N/A,production,"The SUNBURST backdoor uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) as part of C2 communications. This rule looks for each branch of the code that checks for which HTTP method is being used. This is in one large conjunction, and all branches are then tied together via disjunction. The grouping is intentionally designed so that if any part of the DGA is re-used in another sample, this signature should match that re-used portion.
